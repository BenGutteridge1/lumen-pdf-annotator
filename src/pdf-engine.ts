/**
 * pdf-engine.ts — the bulletproof, self-verifying pdf.js setup.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS / THE ARCHITECTURE DECISION
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The community "Annotator" plugin breaks with
 *   "The API version X does not match the Worker version Y"
 * because it lets its bundled pdf.js share global worker config with Obsidian's
 * own internal pdf.js. We make that *structurally impossible*:
 *
 *  1. The rendering API and the worker are imported from the SAME installed
 *     pdfjs-dist package, so their versions are identical by construction.
 *  2. The worker is inlined as a STRING at build time and turned into a Blob URL
 *     at runtime — there is no path on disk to resolve (path resolution is
 *     exactly what breaks the other plugin).
 *  3. We set `workerSrc` ONLY on our own imported `pdfjsLib` module instance.
 *     We never read or write any window-level global that Obsidian's pdf.js
 *     could also touch.
 *
 * pdf.js itself throws the version-mismatch error inside the worker when the
 * API version it is handed differs from the worker's embedded version. Because
 * both come from one install, that branch can never fire. `initPdfEngine()`
 * additionally logs the versions and asserts the worker source literally embeds
 * the API version string, so the guarantee is visible and self-checking.

  //      (different-version) worker → "API version X does not match Worker
  //      version Y" and a blank render.
  //  (2) A SINGLE worker shared across multiple open PDFs makes the 2nd
  //      document's canvas render blank.
  // Solution: give EACH document its own dedicated Worker built from our blob
  // and passed explicitly to getDocument via a per-document PDFWorker (see
